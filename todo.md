# The Ground Shakes - Checkpoint Work Breakdown Structure

# Checkpoint Category Ownership

## 1. Frontend Client to Express API Integration Status
**Owner: Christina (Map + Integration Lead) + Frontend Member**

### Requirements to Complete:
- Document all React components/pages making fetch/axios requests
- List backend endpoints called by each component
- Identify forms sending JSON request bodies
- Document loading states
- Document validation errors
- Document API failure handling

### Christina Tasks:
- [x] Complete earthquake map React component
- [x] Connect map component to earthquake API endpoint
- [x] Display live earthquake data from backend
- [x] Implement markers/popups using API response data
- [x] Handle loading state while map data loads
- [x] Handle API errors on map

### Frontend Member Tasks:
- [x] Complete dashboard UI
- [x] Connect forms to Express API
- [x] Verify JSON request bodies
- [x] Add frontend validation
- [x] Handle failed requests

Deliverable:
- List of React components + API endpoints used

#### Frontend integration summary
- Home page: fetches /api/quakes and normalizes quake data for the map.
- MapComponent: renders OpenLayers markers, shows popup details for each quake, and surfaces loading/error states.
- API request shape handled: flat quake array with lng/lat fields and optional geometry coordinates.
- Loading state: shown while the request is in progress.
- Error state: a visible alert appears when the API request fails.
- Data flow: React state -> normalized quake array -> OpenLayers features -> marker popups.
